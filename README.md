# shortest-snippet-algo

This is a pretty interesting algortithm:

Given a page of content with alphanumeric words, and a search phrase of N words, write an algorithm that will return the shortest snippet of content that contains all N words in any order

For example:
Given the following content -The George Washington Bridge in New York City is one of the oldest bridges ever constructed. It is now being remodeled because the bridge is a landmark. City officials say that the landmark bridge effort will create a lot of new jobs in the city.
And the following search phrase - Landmark City Bridge
The shortest snippet in this case is - bridge is a landmark. City

External libraries used - KnockoutJS / jQUery / Lodash

The focus of this is solving the algorithm itself rather than any UI
